Important Notes
Demo Application: Please note that this is a demo app. We have not specified any backend stack. All backend logic is handled using mock data within the application.
Session Handling: Refreshing the window will reset all data as the mock data gets refreshed. During one session, users can view buses, check seats, and book seats without losing their session data.
